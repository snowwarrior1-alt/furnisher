# Furnisher — Claude Context

## Notes & handoff — READ FIRST when told to "go through your notes"
**`OPUS_BRIEF.md`** (repo root) is the forward roadmap of record: PM/design/security
audits (sections 1-3), delight ideas (4), first-visit cold opens (5, shipped), wave-2 (6),
Fable design notes (7), mobile/web scan (8), and the depth roadmap (9) — plus a **status
ledger at the very top** marking what has shipped vs. what is next. When asked to pick up
the next enhancement: (1) read the brief; (2) run `git log --oneline -20` + `git status` —
a dirty working tree means another agent is mid-flight, so choose a different area or write
specs rather than edit the same files; (3) confirm the item is not already built; (4) build
it with the house conventions (tests, then commit + push).

## Concept
An apartment + furniture **layout planner** — "Sims build mode, pared down." Draw
rooms to scale, drop furniture, check fit before moving in. Built for a friend who
was moving. Deploys to **Vercel** (furnisher.vercel.app).

## Stack
- **Next.js 16** (App Router, static export), **React 19**, **TypeScript**.
- Hand-written CSS in `app/globals.css` (CSS vars, earthy palette; accent `#b5714e`,
  danger `#a8463c`).
- **Supabase** (optional): auth, cloud-save, realtime collaboration. App runs fully
  local if its env vars are unset. Anon key is safe to ship (RLS); never service_role.
  Since July 2026 this is the **shared "Central DB" project** (ref
  `tmycdgnofvmbyrmpqohw`, shared with MapCrowd + Tracker, per-user RLS per app) —
  migration artifacts live in the `unified-backend/` repo in the Mapper-Tracker
  workspace. The old dedicated project (`qkwdjvoeganggqntzeya`) was deleted
  2026-07-18 once the migration was verified.
- **Claude API**, bring-your-own-key (kept only in `localStorage`, sent directly to
  Anthropic) — powers AI import of blueprints / furniture.
- All geometry is stored in **centimetres** (canonical); ft·in ⇄ m·cm is display-only.

## Run / dev
```
# run from the repo root — package.json lives here (app/ is just the App Router dir)
npm.cmd run dev        # serves on http://localhost:3002  (PowerShell: use npm.cmd)
npx tsc --noEmit       # typecheck while iterating
npm.cmd run test       # vitest (pure lib/* logic — trust boundary, geometry, stats)
npm.cmd run build      # production build — NOTE: this stops a running `next dev`
```
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck + test + build on push/PR.
- Prefer `tsc` during iteration; only `build` at commit time (build kills the dev
  server, forcing a restart).
- **Testing the mobile layout is limited**: the dev/browser viewport is effectively
  pinned ~1152px here, so the `@media (max-width:760px)` CSS doesn't render. Test
  mobile *behaviour* via synthetic touch events (`pointerType:'touch'` — touch logic
  is pointer-type gated, not width gated), or temporarily force `isMobile` in
  `app/page.tsx`. Real-device checks are the user's job.

## Security (untrusted plans)
Shared/cloud projects and live collab ops carry plan JSON a peer controls. **Any
field that reaches an SVG `fill`/`stroke` or CSS `background` must be sanitized on
load** via `safeColorField` / `SAFE_COLOR` (`lib/sanitize.ts`) — applied in both
`normalizePlan` (storage.ts) and the collab path. Unsanitized `color:"url(…)"`
would make a viewer's browser fetch an attacker URL. When adding a coloured entity,
wire it through both. URLs go through `safeUrl()`; names are React/serializer-escaped.

## Conventions
- **Always commit and push without asking.** End commit messages with the
  Co-Authored-By line. `.env` is gitignored — never commit secrets.
- Match the surrounding code's style; geometry stays in cm.

## Status (Jul 2026)
Feature-complete and in active polish. `OPUS_BRIEF.md` holds the roadmap.
Recently shipped from it: vitest suite + CI + CSP/BYO-key hardening; a first-run
**template gallery** (`lib/templates/` → `WelcomeModal`, opened via `normalizePlan`;
reopen with the ✨ Templates button); **fit facts** chips in Stats (`stats.fitFacts`);
`lib/interactions.ts` (pure `pointHits`/`objectsInMarquee`/`cycleNext` lifted out of
Canvas.tsx, unit-tested — the first step of the Canvas de-risk); and the **Doorway
Test** — an opt-in "🚪 Move-in check" in Stats (`warnings.moveInCheck`: room-graph
+ widest-path bottleneck vs each rigid piece's smallest cross-section).
Newest: the **insight-layer system** — a pure `lib/layers/` registry (`compute(plan)
→ {overlays, panelRows, warnings}`) rendered by a generic `InsightLayer` SVG comp,
toggled under Display → "Insight layers", persisted in `plan.layers`. First layer =
**L1 clearance zones** (ergonomic aprons from `clearanceStandards.ts`, SAT-tested vs
footprints), **L2 flow/desire-paths** (`walkGrid.ts` wall-aware grid + Dijkstra → daily
routes as worn lines + <70cm pinch points), and **L6 accessibility** (a separate optional
layer: 150cm turning circles via `walkGrid.clearanceAt`, 81cm door minimums, stairs flagged
step-free), and **L3 sun-hours heatmap** (`sunHours.ts` — hourly window beam-casting, furniture
shadows, season presets via `plan.sunSeason` + a Display sub-control; `walkGrid.lightWalls`).
**L4 budget/move-day** (`budget.ts` — per-room bill of materials from `price` + a new
`owned` flag, still-to-buy total, volume→truck estimate, CSV export via a Stats button),
**L5 sightlines/privacy** (`sightlines.ts` — is the bed/toilet visible from the door/a
window via `hasLineOfSight`; TV viewing distance vs screen size), **L7 outlets/power**
(`outlets.ts` — code-spaced wall outlets + extension-run flags for powered pieces), and
**L8 layout-diff** (`layoutDiff.ts` — pin the layout as `plan.ghost`, ghost + move arrows).
**All eight §9 layers now shipped.** Overlay primitives:
polygon/rect/path/circle/badge. Add a layer = append to
`lib/layers/registry.ts` (Display menu + Stats read-out wire up automatically); a layer that
needs a control adds a plan field + a special-cased sub-control (ViewOptionsMenu, e.g. sun-hours)
or action button (StatsPanel, e.g. the budget CSV).
Earlier: room types w/ colour tints, clearance checker (off by default,
bulky-furniture-only heuristic), export strips on-screen chrome, add-tools revert
to Select after one placement, orphan-door selectability, mobile pinch fixes.
Outstanding (see brief): real-device mobile pass; continue the Canvas split
(per-gesture hooks); P2 share links; catalog depth; Doorway Test v2 (rotation /
corridor-turn sweep).
